# Symptoms Please

Symptoms Please is an education game developed for my final year Comprehensive Creative Technologies Module at UWE Bristol. The project was developed in order to provide users with an engaging, fun and private way to learn about sexually transmitted diseases, and potentially in the future other sex education content. The game is primarily an Android mobile game.

## How To Play

In the releases tab of this GitHub repository there are version(s) of the project containing .apk files. To play, download the .apk file onto your Android phone and open it, you will be prompted to install the app.
